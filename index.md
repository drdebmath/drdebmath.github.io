# About Me
I am a Postdoctoral researcher at LUISS Guido Carli, Rome working with [Prof. Giuseppe F. Italiano](http://docenti.luiss.it/italiano/).
I obtained my PhD from the Department of Mathematics, IIT Guwahati under the supervision of [Prof. Partha Sarathi Mandal](https://www.iitg.ac.in/psm/) and [Dr. H. Ramesh](https://www.iitg.ac.in/ramesh_h/). From July to December 2019, I was visiting [Prof. Stefan Schmid](https://www.univie.ac.at/ct/stefan/) at the University of Vienna under the SERB Overseas Visiting Doctoral Fellowship.
