# About Me
I am currently a Postdoctoral researcher at [UQO](https://www.uqo.ca/), Canada working with [Prof. Andrzej Pelc](http://w3.uqo.ca/pelc/main.html).
I obtained my PhD from the Department of Mathematics, IIT Guwahati under the supervision of [Prof. Partha Sarathi Mandal](https://www.iitg.ac.in/psm/) and [Dr. H. Ramesh](https://www.iitg.ac.in/ramesh_h/). From July to December 2019, I was visiting [Prof. Stefan Schmid](https://www.univie.ac.at/ct/stefan/) at the University of Vienna under the SERB Overseas Visiting Doctoral Fellowship. From March to September 2020, I was a visiting scientist at ISI Kolkata working with [Dr. Anisur Rahaman Molla](https://sites.google.com/site/mollaanisurrahaman/). From October 2020 to October 2022, I was a Postdoctoral researcher at [LUISS Guido Carli](https://www.luiss.it), Rome working with [Prof. Giuseppe F. Italiano](https://docenti.luiss.it/italiano/).
